* About

My new emacs configuration(2014) based on "[[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][a reasonable Emacs config]]".

* Installation

To install, clone this repo to ~/.emacs.d, i.e. ensure that the init.el contained in this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

git clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d

#+END_SRC

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party packages will be automatically downloaded and installed.
